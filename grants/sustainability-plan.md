Sustainability Plan

Long-Term Vision

The Reno Revival Stability Project is designed to grow as a sustainable, community-based reentry and stabilization program that reduces reliance on emergency systems while increasing individual self-sufficiency.

Funding Strategy

Program sustainability will be supported through a diversified funding model, including:

- Foundation and faith-based grants
- Local government and reentry funding
- Individual donations and church-based support
- In-kind contributions from community partners

Cost Efficiency

The program emphasizes mentorship, partnerships, and targeted stabilization support to maximize impact while minimizing overhead. Operating under the fiscal sponsorship of Reno Revival Church reduces administrative costs and ensures financial accountability.

Community Partnerships

The project collaborates with local churches, recovery organizations, employers, and housing providers to share resources, reduce duplication of services, and strengthen outcomes.

Growth Plan

Initial funding will support pilot implementation. As outcomes are demonstrated, the program will pursue multi-year funding, expanded partnerships, and potential staffing increases to serve additional participants.
