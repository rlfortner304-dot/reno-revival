Program Narrative

Reno Revival Stability Project

Organizational Overview

The Reno Revival Stability Project is a community-based stability and reentry initiative operating under the 501(c)(3) status of Reno Revival Church. The project exists to support individuals and families experiencing instability due to incarceration, homelessness, substance recovery, and economic hardship. Through faith-informed, trauma-aware programming, the project seeks to restore dignity, stability, and self-sufficiency.

Reno Revival Church serves as the fiscal sponsor and governing nonprofit, providing oversight, financial accountability, and compliance with all grant requirements.

Statement of Need

Many individuals returning from incarceration or crisis face significant barriers to stability, including lack of housing, employment challenges, limited access to supportive services, and social stigma. These barriers increase the risk of recidivism, homelessness, and long-term dependency.

The Reno Revival Stability Project addresses these gaps by providing structured support, mentorship, and access to stabilizing resources during the most critical transition periods.

The Reno Revival Stability Project provides coordinated support services focused on stabilization, accountability, and long-term success. Core components include:

- Reentry and stabilization planning
- Mentorship and peer support
- Connection to housing, employment, and recovery resources
- Life-skills development and accountability support
- Faith-based encouragement combined with practical assistance

Services are delivered in partnership with local agencies, churches, and community organizations to ensure participants receive comprehensive, wraparound support.

Target Population

The program serves adults and families experiencing instability, with a particular focus on individuals reentering the community after incarceration, those on probation or parole, and individuals seeking recovery and life stabilization.

The primary goals of the Reno Revival Stability Project are to:

- Increase housing and personal stability
