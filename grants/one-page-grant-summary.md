Community Need

Individuals returning from incarceration or experiencing crisis face significant barriers to stability, including lack of housing, employment, transportation, and consistent support. These challenges often lead to recidivism, homelessness, and continued economic instability. Northern Nevada lacks coordinated, relationship-based reentry support that addresses both practical needs and personal accountability.

Program Description

The Reno Revival Stability Project is a community-based stabilization and reentry initiative designed to help justice-impacted and high-risk individuals establish sustainable, independent lives. The program provides structured support through mentorship, case coordination, life-skills development, and connections to housing, employment, and recovery resources. Faith-based encouragement is integrated alongside practical services, with participation open regardless of religious affiliation.

Adults (18+) returning from incarceration, on parole or probation, or experiencing instability related to housing, employment, or recovery. Priority is given to individuals at high risk of homelessness or recidivism.
